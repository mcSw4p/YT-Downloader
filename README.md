# YT-Downloader
  
This project is still a work in progress.  
  
YT-Downloader is a application to download and organize youtube videos for plex or other applications. YT-dl downloads a video
via a URL and will also convert the file if necessary. Youtube sometimes splits the audio and video files for their videos. YT-dl 
uses FFmpeg to splice them back together.
